Intro to C2 (Command and Control) 

Command and Control Server: Server handling many revserse connections to it 

Metasploit is a C2 server that generates its call back payload with msfvenom 

Basic layout is agents on victims connecting back to c2 server which the attacker has a single connection to 

Obfuscating results by sleeping the call back time and adding on extra random time, this is reffered to as a jitter 

 
Payload types 

Stageless Payloads 

    Payload begins beaconing back as soon as it is on the Victom machine 

Stages Payloads 

    The initial payload that is on the victim machine is the dropper which is a payload that is just meant to reach back to the c2 server to retrieve the real payload, or parts of the real payload 

Post exploitation 

    Runner sharphound.ps1 

Pivoting Modules 

    Configure the initial target to act as a proxy, launch more attack through the proxy, and establish connections through the proxy

Common C2 Frameworks 

Metasploit, Empire/starkiller, cobalt strike 


Command and Control Redirects  

What is a redirector: a loadbalancer inbetween your victim connections and your c2 server

If a network you are in will flag a c2 server you can position the redirecter inside the network reaching
out to your c2 server outside the network
